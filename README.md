```

## Technical Architecture

NebulaWallet utilizes modern development frameworks and libraries to ensure performance, security, and extensibility:

### Core Technology Stack
- **Next.js 14**: React-based framework providing file-based routing and optimized rendering
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking for enhanced code reliability and maintainability
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling framework for consistent design implementation
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI principles for accessible interface elements
- **Context API**: React state management for efficient application-wide data handling

### Primary Components

1. **Wallet Context (`/context/WalletContext.tsx`)**
   - Centralized state management for wallet operations
   - Connection and disconnection handling with balance update mechanisms
   - Cross-chain functionality switching between Ethereum and Solana
   - Test environment management for transaction simulation

2. **Wallet Generation (`/components/WalletGenerator.tsx`)**
   - Cryptographically secure BIP39 mnemonic phrase generation
   - Multi-protocol key derivation for blockchain-specific requirements
   - Protected information display with security considerations

3. **DeFi Hub (`/components/DeFiHub.tsx`)**
   - Protocol-specific staking interfaces
   - Cross-chain token exchange functionality
   - Yield optimization interfaces (placeholder implementation)

4. **Solana Wallet Connector (`/components/SolanaWalletConnector.tsx`)**
   - Custom UI styling for Solana wallet connection modal
   - Enhanced user experience with improved buttons and navigation
   - Client-side wallet selection and connection handling

5. **Unified Wallet Connector (`/components/UnifiedWalletConnector.tsx`)**
   - Centralized wallet connection interface for multiple blockchains
   - Consistent UI experience across different wallet types
   - Status indicators for connected accounts

### Data Processing Flow

```
User Interaction → Interface Components → Context Actions → Blockchain Protocol Operations → State Updates → Interface Reflection
```

### Security Implementation

- Client-side cryptographic operations for minimized attack surface
- Zero server-side storage of private keys or seed phrases
- Configurable sensitive data masking
- Default read-only operation with explicit transaction approval requirements

## Development Status

NebulaWallet is currently implemented as a functional prototype with the following component status:

### Completed Implementation
- User interface design and interaction patterns
- Wallet generation and import mechanisms
- Cryptocurrency market data visualization
- Test environment functionality
- Protocol switching between Ethereum and Solana

### Partial Implementation
- DeFi staking interface (UI and simulation only)
- Token exchange interface (UI and simulation only)

### Planned Implementation
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Production blockchain transaction handling for staking and other operations
- **Validator Network Connection**: Live validator data integration and staking protocol implementation
- **Liquidity Pool Access**: Decentralized exchange integrations for token swapping
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Functional bridging between Ethereum and Solana ecosystems
- **Hardware Security**: Integration with physical security devices (Ledger, Trezor)
- **Mobile Platform Support**: React Native implementation for cross-platform accessibility

## Production Implementation Requirements
